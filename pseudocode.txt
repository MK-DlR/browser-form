1. set up html form elements
    1a. remember to use novalidate
        - to allow all validation to be done in js
        - should use live inline validation
            - to inform user if field is properly filled in
            - by highlighting field red
            - and providing error message
    1b. can use different input types
        - but need to use js to check and report validity
    1c. form sections
        - email
        - country
        - postal code
        - password
        - password confirmation

2. add the js code
    2a. that checks validation
        - as the user progresses through the form
    2b. when the user leaves a form field
        - it should automatically validate that field

3. style validations with css
    3a. by using pseudoclasses
        - :valid
        - :invalid
